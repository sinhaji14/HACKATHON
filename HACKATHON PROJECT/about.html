				<p>Welcome to <i>lefties</i>, where we are on a mission to make a meaningful difference in the lives of those in need. Our story is rooted in 
				compassion, community, and the desire to combat food waste while feeding the hungry and homeless.</p>

				<h2>Our Mission</h2>
			</div>
			
			<div>
				<p>At <i>lefties</i>, our mission is twofold:</p>
			</div>

			<div>
				<p>Reducing Food Waste: We are committed to addressing the issue of food waste, which plagues the restaurant and hotel industry. Each day, perfectly good food is discarded, contributing to environmental concerns and societal inequalities. We collaborate with restaurants, hotels, and catering services to rescue surplus, untouched, and quality food that would otherwise go to waste.</p>
			</div>

			<div>
				<p>Feeding the Hungry and Homeless: Simultaneously, we channel this rescued food directly to the most vulnerable members of our community. We work tirelessly to ensure that no one has to go to bed hungry, by distributing nutritious meals to shelters, community centers, and individuals who are homeless or food-insecure.</p>
			</div>

				<h2>Our Story</h2>
			</div>

			<div>
				<p><i>lefties</i> was founded by a group of individuals who came together with a shared vision to tackle two pressing issues - food waste and food insecurity. We firmly believe that the abundance of food should never coexist with hunger, and we strive to bridge this gap. With a strong background in both the hospitality industry and social work, our founders saw a unique opportunity to create a bridge between excess food and those who needed it most.</p>
			</div>
		</section>

		<section class="hidden" id="oa">
			<div>
				<h2>Our Approach</h2>
			</div>

			<div>
				<p>We take a hands-on approach to fulfill our mission:</p>
			</div>
			
			<div>
				<p>Collaboration: We partner with local restaurants, hotels, and catering businesses to collect their surplus food. Our partnerships help reduce food waste at its source.</p>
			</div>
			
			<div>
				<p>Redistribution: Once collected, our dedicated team ensures that this rescued food is promptly and safely delivered to shelters and community centers, as well as directly to individuals in need.</p>
			</div>
			
			<div>
				<p>Nutrition and Dignity: We prioritize providing not just meals, but nutritious meals that cater to the diverse needs of our recipients. Our aim is not only to address hunger but to nourish individuals with dignity and respect.</p>
			</div>

		<section class="hidden" id="oi">
			<div>
				<h2>Our Impact</h2>
			</div>

			<div>
				<p>Since our inception, we have rescued countless meals, served thousands of individuals, and helped reduce the carbon footprint by curbing food waste. Our impact goes beyond numbers - it's seen in the smiles of those we feed, the sense of purpose in our volunteers, and the collective effort to build a more compassionate community.</p>

				<h2>Join Us in Making a Difference</h2>
			</div>
			
			<div>
				<p>We believe that social change starts with collective action. You can be a part of our mission by volunteering, donating, or simply spreading the word about <i>lefties</i>. Together, we can create a world where no one goes to bed hungry and where surplus food nourishes those who need it most.</p>
			</div>
			
			<div>
				<p>Thank you for joining us on this meaningful journey. Together, we can make a difference, one meal at a time.</p>
